    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

	<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

	<p>
		Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of
		your <abbr>PhD</abbr>  next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
	</p>

    <p><h2>Starting dates</h2></p>

	<p>
		We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
		could
		start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
	</p>

    <ul>
		<li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
		<li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
		<li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
	</ul>

    <p>
		Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates </a>on our website.
